                    into their lives because they don’t have enough information. Through a 3-week design sprint, I
                    designed an app that gamifies sustainability, called greener. This app will provide users with a fun
                    way to learn responsible habits.</p>

                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>Sustainable behaviors are overlooked due to people not having the time and energy to figure out how.
                    This shift in behavior also requires the introduction of mundane tasks that lack immediacy for the
                    user.</p>
                <p> Through designing Greener, I wanted to figure out <span class="bold"> how might we encourage users
                        to learn more about sustainability in a fun and engaging way?</span></p>

                        those who have never implemented sustainable practices to those who have but want an engaging

                        wireframes, prototypes, and final user testing. I also collaborated with my mentor Becky for
                        assistance along the way. She provided me with feedback from the Discover to the Deliver phases.
                        I used Figma, Illustrator, InVision, and Adobe XD.

                    <p>The scope of the project is to create an app that uses gamification features to gamify
                        sustainability. The end goal is a simplified version of the game. Greener was built in a 3-week
                        design sprint, which limited the amount of research and features added.</p>

                <h3>The Solution</h3>
                <p>I have created greener, an app that gamifies sustainability.</p>
                <p>User testing verified that most don’t apply sustainable behaviors to their lives due to not
                    understanding or having time to lookup resources. Behavior development requires a cue, routine,
                    and a reward, which can be synthesized through gamification elements such as leaderboards,
                    badges, points, progress bars, levels, and prizes. Engagement is also increased with a social
                    element.</p>
                <p>Greener starts a user at Level 1 with a set of challenges to complete. As users complete
                        challenges, they earn XP points and see how much their challenges reduced their carbon
                        footprint. Users can see their accomplishments on their profile, see what their friends are
                        doing on the feed and finally see where they stand overall on the Leaderboard.</p>

                <h3>Discovery &#38; Research</h3>
                <p>Greener started as a big concept with many moving parts. To narrow in on the scope, I started the
                    sprint by mapping out the problem and creating a flow chart.</p>
                <p>I researched habit-forming behaviors and assessed what other apps are doing with lightning demos. I
                    found that Strava, DuoLingo, and Love to Ride were great examples of apps that encompass
                    gamification.</p>
                <p>From the research and lightning demos, I was able to identify two personas that fit into the scope of
                    this project; Lazy Larry and Green Mom.</p><br>

                        easier and exciting.</p>
                    <p>I broke the initial flow up into 5 different sections from the home screen. The app would need
                        challenges and a recording screen to get users to do sustainable practices. It also needed an
                        interactive aspect such as a leaderboard, profile, and feed to keep users motivated through
                        social influence.</p>

                        either a tile with less information, similar to Duo Lingo, or a list with more comprehensive

                        and an activity feed. The 4-up sketches all had the same features, just different arrangements
                        of information. DuoLingo was also a big influence on this layout.
                    </p>
                    <p>Finally, the <span class="bold">Feed and Leaderboard</span> needed an aspect of social influences
                        and competitive edge. The 4-up sketches were influenced by Instagram with the leaders displayed
                        like Stories and the feed below. To reduce cognitive load another version had the Leaderboard
                        and Feed as tabbed features on one screen.

            <h3>Visual Design</h3>
                <p>As I developed the assets for Greener, I wanted it to feel fun, natural, and simple to reflect the
                    aspects of the game and sustainability. The colors and typography went through a few iterations
                    before I found the right combo</p>

                <div class="accordion-container">
                    <p>I wanted to find colors that were fun, natural, and simple. The first round of colors included a
                        seafoam green and darker blue. After implementing the colors into the hi-fi mockups, I realized
                        that the colors clashed.</p>
                    <p>I eventually landed on another variation of green and blue that were more complementary. This
                        color palette also has a high contrast for those who experience color blindness.
                    </p>
                    <p>Similar to the color palette, I wanted a simple font type that was also web-safe. I first chose
                        Ariel but changed it to Proxima Soft. Proxima Soft was more playful and fit well with the images
                        and icons in the app.</p><br>
                    <p>While deciding on the font size and weight, I also used the apple accessibility guidelines.</p>

                    <p>I wanted the name to be related to gaming as well as sustainability. I explored words associated
                        with “Eco” or “Virid” but found both are widely used for environmental-based companies.</p>
                    <p>I also came across Greenie, which is defined as someone who campaigns to protect the environment.
                        I felt this could have a negative connotation with some users. The term Greenie did remind me of
                        conversations I’ve had in the past where people expressed wanting to be “More Green” or
                        “Greener”. After a quick app store and domain search, I discovered it was unique, so it seemed
                        like a perfect fit.</p>
                    <p>With inspiration from the name, I designed the logo as a green tree made of three arrows
                        pointing. The arrows could also signify leveling up.</p>

                    With the style guide complete, I added color and type to the wireframes. Gamifying sustainability is
                    a unique concept and required a couple of rounds of usability and preference testing to make sure it
                    was intuitive for all users. Greener is currently on its 4th iteration.

                    clickable items. Some of the alignment and drop shadows also needed to be adjusted for better flow.
                </p>
                <p><span class="bold">V2.</span> I changed the challenges layout to list form intead of tiles, to
                    provide users with more information. The recording screens first iteration included drop down menus,
                    but I added segmented controls to prevent scrolling and it provided a cool visual. Finally due to
                    confusion of where to start once users were in the app I added a onboarding carousel so users knew
                    what to do once in the app.
                </p>
                <p><span class="bold">V3.</span> After the usability test and some preference testing I updated the
                    onboarding flow and some of the icons.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">V4.</span> After V3 I decided to put Greener through the visual design ringer. I
                    updated the color palette with more pastels changed the typography to Proxima Soft for a more
                    playful look. I also separated the feed and leaderboard to remove any confusion still associated
                    with the original layout. </p>

                    <p>After V2 iterations I tested the usability with 3 participants. Similar to the screens I broke
                        the tasks up into 4 parts. I wanted to see:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>If it was intuitive for a user to pick a challenge</li>
                        <li>What steps the users took to Record</li>
                        <li>How users interact with the Profile</li>
                        <li>How users interact and navigate the Feederboard</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>After testing, the users averaged an <span class="bold">84%</span> success rate.</p>
                    <p>There were three things that stood out:</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">1</span> user skipped the onboarding walk through and wasn't
                        sure where to start once in the game.</p>
                    <p> <span class="bold">1</span> user didn't notice the segmented tabs on the
                        recording screen, and another clicked around before finding the tabs.</p>

                    <p>After testing I created two preference tests. The first was for the onboarding walk through

                    <p>Since one user skipped the onboarding walk through and also had trouble starting I created an
                        overlay tutorial as an alternative. All users liked the overlay better with one user commenting:
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="quote">“I’m more prone to skip tutorials like A.”
                        </span></p>
                    <p>In the overlay tutorial I also highlighted the tabs on the Feederboard screen to assist any other
                        users who might not notice the tabs.</p>

                                the tabs themselves. For the second preference test I updated the connection of the tabs. All

            <h3>Conclusion </h3>
            <h4>Growth and Outcomes</h4>
                    <p>Greener has been an idea since 2015, so it’s been really cool to see this app come to life. It
                        was a fun and interesting exercise to build the app as a sprint.</p>
                    <p>As my first sprint I learned a lot through each step. I enjoyed the fast pace of getting ideas
                        out however I would find myself getting stuck in the weeds as I navigated most of this project
                        solo.</p>
                    <p>Initial research and lightning demos helped me understand the concepts of gamification better.
                        It’s a pretty cool learning tool.</p>
                    <p>As a solo sprinter I wish I would have gotten more feedback earlier and done more preference
                        testing. With a bigger concept in mind I experienced scope creep which caused unnecessary work
                        along the way. With a clearer vision of the app I’m excited to keep working and testing this
                        concept.</p>
