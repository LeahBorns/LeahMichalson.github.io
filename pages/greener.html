                <p class="case-study-description">Studies have shown that the main reason people don’t incorporate sustainable practices into their lives is because they don’t have enough information. Through a 3 week design sprint I designed an app that gamifies sustainability, called greener. This app will provide users with a fun way to learn responsible habits.</p>

        <section id="problem">
            <div id="statement">
                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>Sustainable behaviors are frequently overlooked due to people not having the time and energy to figure out how. This shift in behavior also requires the introduction of mundane tasks that lack immediacy for the user. The problem is this; how might we encourage users to learn more about sustainability in a fun and engaging way?</p>

                    <p>This app is for users who are interested in learning more about sustainability. It is suited for those who have never implemented sustainable practices to those you have but want an engaging reminder to keep it up.</p>

                    <p>I was the User Experience Designer. I conducted user research, created the personas, user flows, wireframes, prototypes and final user testing. I also collaborated with my mentor Becky for assistance along the way. She provided me with feedback from the Discover to the Deliver phases. I used Figma, Illustrator and InVision.

                    <p>The scope of the project is to create an app that uses gamification features to gamify sustainability. The end goal will be a simplified version of the game. The app was built in a 3 week design sprint which limited the amount of research and features added. </p>

                    <h2>The Solution</h2>
                    <p>I have developed greener, an app that gamifies sustainability. User-testing verified that the reason most don’t participate in applying sustainable behaviors to their lives is due to not understanding or having time to look up resources. Behavior development requires a cue, routine and a reward which can be synthesized through gamification elements such as leaderboards, badges, points, progress bars, levels and prizes. Engagement is also increased with a social element. Greener starts a user at level 1 with a set of challenges to complete. As users complete challenges they earn XP points, and can also see how much their challenge reduced their carbon footprint. Users can see their personal accomplishments on their profile and head over to the Feederboard, a tabbed screen, where they can interact with what their friends are doing as well as see where they stand overall on the leaderboard </p>

            <h3>Discovery &#38; Research</h3>
            <div id="lightning-intro">
                <h4>Lightning Demos</h4>
                <p>As part of the sprint I performed lightning demos to research and start brainstorming ideas for the app. I found that <span>Strava</span>, <span>DuoLingo</span>, and <span>Love to Ride</span> were all great examples of apps that encompass gamification.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="lightning-demos">
                <div id="lightning-descriptions">
                    <p>Strava's feed is easy to navigate to quickly see what others have been up to. Users can choose from a variety of challenges. Each challenge had a list and a short description of each challenge which reduced an extra click on the challenge for additional information The profile allows users to see their stats from all of their activities as well as see who they are following and who is following them.</p>
        <br>
                    <p>Duolingo is the epitome of gamifying apps. It has badges, levels, points, you name it. You can immediately start challenges on the opening screen. The information is simple and requires some assumptions of what each challenge is and what level you are on. More information would be helpful. The profile is clean with all of the users stats in an easily digestible way. The leaderboard is only accessible if you complete challenges for that day which is a great way to encourage users to do challenges. Duolingo also has daily notifications to remind you to ‘practice’. This feature is nice but it also gets annoying.</p>
<br>
                    <p>Love to Ride is a web platform that teams up companies to encourage their employees to ride their bikes to work. The profile has badges and overall stats of all rides. It’s very easy to navigate and the icons make it fun. There is a full history of your activity to compare from years past as well. Recording is really easy, especially since it’s linked up with Strava and the leaderboard is broken into different sections such as Top Commuters, Riders, Men, Woman and Kids so there can be more than one leader. The interface is very clean and easy to navigate.</p>
<br>
                    <p>Aside from lightning demos, I found an app that gamified sustainability called EcoCRED. EcoCRED lets users choose from a list of sustainable habits that they can complete by checking it off for the day. Each challenge has a good description with points and the amount of CO2 reduced. The user has to scroll to the bottom of the page to see the challenges so it’s not immediately clear what to do on the Home Screen. Recording the challenges is very simple but also heavily reliant on the honor system. It also limits the amount of data collected that could be helpful to understand users more. The app has badges for multiple day streaks, points, and CO2 reduced. These are great features for motivating users. There is also a friends element where you can connect with your friends via facebook. This feature is still in development mode.

                <h4>Personas</h4>
                <p>Through Journey Mapping and Empathy Maps I developed the target audience for Greener. From this I came up with two personas. One user is a busy Mom who wants to be more sustainable but isn’t sure how. She’s become much more aware of sustainable practices and wants to be a good example for her kids. While one kid is taking a nap and the other is off at school she has some downtime to learn but ideally she just wants to be told what to do. She uses apps like DuoLingo and Candy Crush.

                    The other user grew up recycling, eating vegetarian, and doing other sustainable practices regularly. As life has gotten more busy he’s started to be less strict on his sustainable behaviors.  Partially laziness and also convenience. He’s expressed this to friends, and they have been doing the same thing. He wishes there was something to encourage him to do more.  He uses Strava to track his rides and is a big Pokemon GO fan.
