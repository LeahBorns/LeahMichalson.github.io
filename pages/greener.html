                <p class="case-study-description">Studies have shown that the main reason people don’t incorporate sustainable practices into their lives is because they don’t have enough information. Through a 3 week design sprint I designed an app that gamifies sustainability, called greener. This app will provide users with a fun way to learn responsible habits.</p>

                <p>Sustainable behaviors are frequently overlooked due to people not having the time and energy to figure out how. This shift in behavior also requires the introduction of mundane tasks that lack immediacy for the user. Through designing Greener I wanted to figure out <span class="bold"> how might we encourage users to learn more about sustainability in a fun and engaging way?</span></p>

I also collaborated with my mentor Becky for assistance along the way. She provided me with feedback from the Discover to the Deliver phases. I used Figma, Illustrator and InVision.

                    <p>I have developed greener, an app that gamifies sustainability.</p><br>
                    <p>User testing verified that the reason most don’t participate in applying sustainable behaviors to their lives is due to not understanding or having time to look up resources. Behavior development requires a cue, routine and a reward which can be synthesized through gamification elements such as leaderboards, badges, points, progress bars, levels and prizes. Engagement is also increased with a social element.</p><br> <p>Greener starts a user at level 1 with a set of challenges to complete. As users complete challenges they earn XP points, and can also see how much their challenges reduced their carbon footprint. Users can see their personal accomplishments on their profile, see what their friends are doing on the feed and finally see where they stand overall on the Leaderboard.</p>

                <p>Greener started as a big concept with many moving parts. To narrow in on the scope of this project I started the sprint by mapping out the problem and creating a flow chart.</p><br>
                <p>I wanted the app to focus on two users, sustainability newbies and those who already practice but need an extra push. The ultimate goal of the app would be to make sustainable practices more easy and interesting.</p><br>
                <p>The initial flow of the app was broken up into 5 different sections from the home screen. The app would need challenges and a recording screen to get users to do sustainable practices. It also needed an interactive aspect such as a leaderboard, profile and feed to keep users motivated through social influence.</p>

                <p>To get into the headspace of our users and answer the <em>how</em> of the user experience I created a journey and empathy map. Targeting the users and goals from the mapping exercise users want an easy and fun way to learn sustainable practices that are often mundane tasks. <br><br> The users journey starts by opening the app to the challenges screen where they can see what level they are on and complete challenges for points. By recording their challenges the user can see their accomplishments, including badges, challenges history and total amount of co2 reduced, on their profile. Users can see what their friends are doing on the feed where they can interact with their posts by liking, commenting or sharing as well as see where they stand on the leaderboard for some friendly socially influenced competition.</p>

                    <p>Through Journey Mapping and Empathy Maps I developed the target audience for Greener. From this I came up with two personas. </p><br>

                    <p>One user is a busy Mom who wants to be more sustainable but isn’t sure how. She’s become much more aware of sustainable practices and wants to be a good example for her kids. While one kid is taking a nap and the other is off at school she has some downtime to learn but ideally she just wants to be told what to do. She uses apps like DuoLingo and Candy Crush.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The other user grew up recycling, eating vegetarian, and doing other sustainable practices regularly. As life has gotten more busy he’s started to be less strict on his sustainable behaviors. Partially laziness and also convenience. He’s expressed this to friends, and they have been doing the same thing. He wishes there was something to encourage him to do more. He uses Strava to track his rides and is a big Pokemon GO fan.

                <h4>Wireframe Sketches</h4>
                <div class="wireframe-sketch">
                    <p>With personas and a storyboard developed I began sketching the first
                        iteration of Greener. I split the screens up into 4 sections: </p><br>

                <div class="list">
                <ol>
                    <li>Challenges</li>
                    <li>Recording</li>
                    <li>Profile</li>
                    <li>Feed/Leaderboard</li>
                </ol>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p>I created 4-up sketches for each with a final solution sketch. Since
                        gamification features went hand in hand with creating a habit I remixed
                        features on Duo Lingo and Strava to start creating the concepts.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I wanted the <span class="bold">challenges</span> screen to show what level the user was on, a
                        progress bar and a way to list each challenge out without increasing
                        cognitive load. The two overarching concepts had the challenges listed as
                        either buttons with less information, similar to Duo Lingo or a list with
                        more comprehensive information similar to Strava. I decided to move
                        forward with the DuoLingo-esque features.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The <span class="bold">recording</span> sketches began as one recording screen however also due
                        to reducing cognitive load I broke it down into 3 screens. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="screen-details"><span class="bold">Screen 1</span> records specific challenges selected
                    </p><br>
                    <p class="screen-details"><span class="bold">Screen 2</span> allows users to gain extra points for adding
                        pictures or comments
                    </p><br>
                    <p class="screen-details"><span class="bold">Screen 3</span> allows users to submit their points earned,
                        CO2 reduced and an option to share for extra points.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Similar to the challenges screen I knew I wanted the <span class="bold">profile</span> screen to have user
                        stats, progress bars, badges, and an activity feed. The 4-up sketches all had the
                        same features, just different arrangements of information. DuoLingo was also a
                        big influence for the layout.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Finally, the <span class="bold">Feed and Leaderboard</span> provided social influences through interacting
                        with friends posts as well as see where they stand overall. The 4-up sketches
                        started with influence from Instagram. The Feed of friends posts with the leaders
                        displayed similar to instagram stories. In effort to reduce cognitive overload
                        another version had the Leaderboard and Feed as tabbed features on one screen.

                    <div class="color-palette">
                        <h4>Color Palette</h4>
                        <p>I wanted the color palette to feel fun, natural, and simple to reflect the
                            aspects of the game and sustainability. The first round of colors included a
                            sea foam green and darker blue however after implementing them into the
                            design I realized that the colors clashed.</p> <br>
                            <p>Still focusing on the greens and
                            blues I came up with another color palette with more complementary
                            colors. The body of the app had a mix of a lighter and darker blue with a
                            lighter and darker green for accents and buttons. This color palette also has
                            a high contrast for those whose experience color blindness.

                        <p>Similar to the color palette I wanted a simple font type that was also a web
                            safe font. I first chose Ariel however after the first iteration changed it to
                            Proxima Nova and then finally to Proxima Soft. I felt the rounder edges were
                            more playful and fit well with the images and icons in the app.</p>

                    <p>I wanted the name to be related to gaming as well as sustainability. It turned out that most names with “Eco” were already used, as well as other sustainability related words including Virid.</p><br>
                    <p>I also came across Greenie, which is defined as someone who campaigns to protect the environment. I felt this could have a negative connotation with some users. It did however remind me of conversations I’ve had in the past where people expressed wanting to be “More Green” or “Greener”. After an app store search, there were no search results for greener so I move ahead with that name.</p><br>
                    <p>With a name like “Greener”, the logo should probably be green. I played around with the two greens I used in the app as well as with simple shapes to match the images and icons in the app itself. After a few iterations I landed on a tree made of three arrows pointing up to signify leveling up.</p><br>
                    <p>Finally after iterating on the colors I landed on the more blue green version.</p>

                <div class="iterations">
                    <p>Prior to usability testing the visual design went through a couple bigger
                        changes. The first iterations color palette clashed and there wasn’t a
                        dominant color for clickable items. Some of the alignment and drop
                        shadows also needed to be adjusted for better flow.</p><br>
                    <p>On the challenges screen I changed the layout to list form, similar to Strava
                        challenges. The recording screens first iteration included drop down menus,
                        but I added segmented controls to prevent scrolling and it provided a cool
                        visual. Finally due to confusion of where to start once users were in the app
                        I added onboarding walk through screens so users knew what to do once in
                        the app. I also started calling the Feed/Leaderboard the Feederboard for
                        simplicity and users understood the screen more.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>After the usability test and some preference testing I updated the color
                        palette and typography and separated the feed and leaderboard to remove
                        any confusion still associated with the original layout. I also updated some
                        of the icons.</p>

                    <p>After making the above adjustments I tested usability with 3 participants.
                        Similar to the screens I broke the tasks up into 4 parts. I wanted to see:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>If it was intuitive for a user to pick a challenge</li>

                        <li>How users interact and navigate the Feederboard</li>

                        version of the recording screen.</p><br>
                    <p>Since one user skipped the onboarding walk through and also had
                        trouble starting I created an overlay tutorial as an alternative. All users
                        liked the overlay better with one user commenting:</p><br>
                    <p><span class="quote">“I’m more prone to skip tutorials like ‘A’.”
                        </span></p><br>
                    <p>In the overlay tutorial I also highlighted the tabs on the Feederboard
                        screen to assist any other users who might not notice the tabs.</p>

                        preference test I updated the connection of the tabs. All users found

                    <p>Greener has been an idea since 2015, so it’s been really cool to see this app come to life. It was a fun and interesting exercise to build the app as a sprint.</p><br>
                    <p>As my first sprint I learned a lot through each step. I enjoyed the fast pace of getting ideas out however I would find myself getting stuck in the weeds as I navigated most of this project solo.</p><br>
                    <p>Initial research and lightning demos helped me understand the concepts of gamification better. It’s a pretty cool learning tool.</p><br>
                    <p>As a solo sprinter I wish I would have gotten more feedback earlier and done more preference testing. With a bigger concept in mind I experienced scope creep which caused unnecessary work along the way. With a clearer vision of the app I’m excited to keep working and testing this concept.</p>
