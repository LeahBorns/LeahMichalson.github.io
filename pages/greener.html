                <div id="solution-statement">
                    <p>I have developed greener, an app that gamifies sustainability. User-testing verified that the reason most don’t participate in applying sustainable behaviors to their lives is due to not understanding or having time to look up resources. Behavior development requires a cue, routine and a reward which can be synthesized through gamification elements such as leaderboards, badges, points, progress bars, levels and prizes. Engagement is also increased with a social element. Greener starts a user at level 1 with a set of challenges to complete. As users complete challenges they earn XP points, and can also see how much their challenge reduced their carbon footprint. Users can see their personal accomplishments on their profile and head over to the Feederboard, a tabbed screen, where they can interact with what their friends are doing as well as see where they stand overall on the leaderboard </p>

            <div class="mapping-hmw" data-aos="fade-down">
                <p>Greener started as a big concept with many moving parts. To narrow in on the focus of this project I started the sprint by mapping out the problem and creating a flow chart. I wanted the app to focus on two users, sustainability newbies and those who already practice but need an extra push. The ultimate goal of the app would be to make sustainable practices more easy and interesting. The inital flow of the app was broken up into 5 different sections from the home screen. The app would need challenges and a recording screen to get users to do sustainable practices. It also needed an interactive aspect such as a leaderboard, profile and feed to keep users motivated through social influence.</p>

                <h4>Lightning Demos</h4>
                <p>As part of the sprint I performed lightning demos to research and start brainstorming ideas for the app. I found that <span>Strava</span>, <span>DuoLingo</span>, and <span>Love to Ride</span> were all great examples of apps that encompass gamification.</p>

                    <p>Strava's feed is easy to navigate to quickly see what others have been up to. Users can choose from a variety of challenges. Each challenge had a list and a short description of each challenge which reduced an extra click on the challenge for additional information The profile allows users to see their stats from all of their activities as well as see who they are following and who is following them.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Duolingo is the epitome of gamifying apps. It has badges, levels, points, you name it. You can immediately start challenges on the opening screen. The information is simple and requires some assumptions of what each challenge is and what level you are on. More information would be helpful. The profile is clean with all of the users stats in an easily digestible way. The leaderboard is only accessible if you complete challenges for that day which is a great way to encourage users to do challenges. Duolingo also has daily notifications to remind you to ‘practice’. This feature is nice but it also gets annoying.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Love to Ride is a web platform that teams up companies to encourage their employees to ride their bikes to work. The profile has badges and overall stats of all rides. It’s very easy to navigate and the icons make it fun. There is a full history of your activity to compare from years past as well. Recording is really easy, especially since it’s linked up with Strava and the leaderboard is broken into different sections such as Top Commuters, Riders, Men, Woman and Kids so there can be more than one leader. The interface is very clean and easy to navigate.</p>

                <p>To get into the headspace of our users and answer the <em>how</em> of the user experience I created a journey and empathy map. Targeting the users and goals from the mapping exercise users want an easy and fun way to learn sustainable practices that are often mundane tasks. <br><br> The users journey starts by opening the app to the challenges screen where they can see what level they are on and complete challenges for points. By recording their challenges the user can see their accomplishments, including badges, challenges history and total amount of co2 reduced, on their profile. Users can see what their friends are doing on the feed where they can interact with their posts by liking, commenting or sharing as well as see where they stand on the leaderboard for some friendly socially influenced competition.</p>

                    <p>Through Journey Mapping and Empathy Maps I developed the target audience for Greener. From this I came up with two personas. One user is a busy Mom who wants to be more sustainable but isn’t sure how. She’s become much more aware of sustainable practices and wants to be a good example for her kids. While one kid is taking a nap and the other is off at school she has some downtime to learn but ideally she just wants to be told what to do. She uses apps like DuoLingo and Candy Crush. The other user grew up recycling, eating vegetarian, and doing other sustainable practices regularly. As life has gotten more busy he’s started to be less strict on his sustainable behaviors. Partially laziness and also convenience. He’s expressed this to friends, and they have been doing the same thing. He wishes there was something to encourage him to do more. He uses Strava to track his rides and is a big Pokemon GO fan.

                <p>To better understand and empathize with the user I created a storyboard to visualize how the user would flow through the app. This version of the story highlights the persona like Lazy Larry.

                <h4>Wireframe Sketches</h4>
                <div class="wireframe-sketch">
                    <p>With personas and a storyboard developed I began sketching the first iteration of Greener. I split the screens up into 4 sections: Challenges, Recording, Profile and, Feed/Leaderboard and created 4-up sketches for each with a final solution sketch. Since gamification features went hand in hand with creating a habit I remixed features on Duo Lingo and Strava to start creating the concepts.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I wanted the challenges screen to show what level the user was on, a progress bar and a way to list each challenge out without increasing cognitive load. The two overarching concepts had the challenges listed as either buttons with less information, similar to Duo Lingo or a list with more comprehensive information similar to Strava. I decided to move forward with the DuoLingo-esque features.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The recording sketches began as one recording screen however also due to reducing cognitive load I broke it down into 3 screens. Screen 1 records specific challenges selected, Screen 2 allows users to gain extra points for adding pictures or comments, and finally a submit screen that summarizes points earned, CO2 reduced and an option to share for extra points.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Similar to the challenges screen I knew I wanted the profile screen to have user stats, progress bars, badges, and an activity feed. The 4-up sketches all had the same features, just different arrangements of information. DuoLingo was also a big influence for the layout.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Finally, the Feed and Leaderboard provided social influences through interacting with friends posts as well as see where they stand overall. The 4-up sketches started with influence from Instagram. The Feed of friends posts with the leaders displayed similar to instagram stories. In effort to reduce cognitive overload another version had the Leaderboard and Feed as tabbed features on one screen.

                        <p>I wanted the color palette to feel fun, natural, and simple to reflect the aspects of the game and sustainability. The first round of colors included a sea foam green and darker blue however after implementing them into the design I realized that the colors clashed. Still focusing on the greens and blues I came up with another color palette with more complementary colors. The body of the app had a mix of a lighter and darker blue with a lighter and darker green for accents and buttons. This color palette also had a high contrast for those whose experience color blindness.</p>

                    <p>I started developing the name by coming up with a list of names related to games as well as sustainability. It turned out that most names with “Eco” were already used, as well as other sustainability related words including Virid. I also came across Greenie, which is someone who campaigns to protect the environment. I thought maybe this could have a negative connotation with some users. It did however remind me of conversations I’ve had in the past where people expressed wanting to be “More Green” or “Greener”. After an app store search, there were no search results for greener so I move ahead with that name.
                        <br><br> With a name like “Greener”, the logo should probably be green. I played around with the two greens I used in the app as well as with simple shapes to match the images and icons in the app itself. After a few iterations I landed on a tree made of three arrows pointing up to signify leveling up.

                    <p>Prior to usability testing the visual design went through a couple bigger changes. The first iterations color palette clashed and there was no dominant color for clickable items. Some of the alignment and drop shadows also needed to be adjusted for better flow.
                        <br><br> On the challenges screen I changed the layout to list form, similar to strava challenges to provide more information to the user. The recording screens first iteration included drop down menus, but I added segmented controls to prevent scrolling and it provided a cool visual. Finally due to confusion of where to start once users were in the app I added onboarding walk through screens so users knew what to do once in the app. I also started calling the Feed/Leaderboard the Feederboard for simplicity and users understood the screen more.

Through gamification features such as leaderboards and badges as well as social influence by way of the feed users can develop sustainable habits through the cue of the challenges and a reward for completing those challenges. From here I want to do further preference testing on features to see what users find more engaging, as well as find easier ways for users to record.</p>

                    <p>Greener has been an idea since 2015, so it’s been really cool to see this app come to life. It was a fun and interesting exercise to build the app as a sprint. As my first sprint it was a learning curve to walk through each step. I enjoyed the fast pace of getting ideas out however I would find myself getting stuck in the weeds as I navigated most of this project solo. Initial research and lightning demos helped me understand the concepts of gamification better. It’s a pretty cool learning tool. As a solo sprinter I wish I would have gotten more feedback earlier on and done more preference testing. With a bigger concept in mind I experienced scope creep which caused unnecessary work along the way. With a clearer vision of the app I’m excited to keep working and testing this concept.
