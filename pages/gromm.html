                <p class="case-study-description">Left Coast Bicycles (LCB) is a mobile bike repair company. They primarily have events at office buildings where they offer bike safety checks and bike repair to large groups. LCB currently uses 3 different platforms to schedule and remind customers of their upcoming consultation and repair. The owner really wishes there was a way to streamline his scheduling process. Through the design process, we created Gromm, an app that combines scheduling, reminders, and payment all in one app.</p>

                    <p>The solution is a bike repair scheduling app called, Gromm. Clients can schedule, receive reminders and alerts, and pay all in one place.</p><br>
                    <p>The current prototype is the client facing part of the app. Users can schedule a 15-minute consultation with the onsite mechanic, see their upcoming and past appointments, receive reminders before their appointment, and a reminder and final summary of when their bike is done. This will provide faster service for the client and a more streamlined system for the mechanic.</p>

                <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
                <p>For the competitive analysis, I wanted to dig into other scheduling apps and mobile bike repair companies to see how they schedule their clients.
                </p><br>
                <p>I landed on Velofix and Beeline for mobile bike repair and SimplyBook.me for just scheduling. </p>

            <div class="competitive-analysis" data-aos="fade-down">
                <p>The biggest takeaways were: </p><br>
                <p><span class="bold">Velofix</span> uses Vonigo, a third party service management api to schedule and manage their mobile bike repair fleet. Through the Velofix platform, you can schedule, get reminders, and pay. While everything is in one place there isn't a mobile platform, the layout is busy and discrete events can't be scheduled.
                </p><br>
                <p><span class="bold">Beeline</span> is a unique company that offers a scheduling platform for the bike industry. Their software allows users and mechanics to schedule repairs, and organize inventory all in one place. They do offer scheduling for discrete events however it's for a time range vs specific intervals. Beeline also doesn't have a mobile platform.
                </p><br>
                <p><span class="bold">SimplyBook.me</span> Simplybook.me is a popular scheduling platform that is easy to navigate, it updates in real time and sends notifications. Like the other scheduling apps they also don't support scheduling for discrete events.</p>

                <h4>User Survey</h4>
                <p>To get a better idea of the users I sent out a survey to LCB's clients get a better understanding of their goals and frustrations with the current system.</p><br>
                <p>Out of <span class="bold">19 participants</span>, I found that while most users like real time scheduling many users desired more communication and integrated features. Some of these included <span class="bold"> email confirmation, the ability to add an event to their calendar, and pay for service in the app.</span></p><br>
                <p>I was surprised to find that more people wanted a clearer way to reschedule as well as a summary alert once their bike repair was complete compared to getting event reminders. </p>

                <p>I broke the user flows up into 3 different parts. The second and third flows get a little more complicated as it's dependent on the mechanic's input. To keep everything in scope each flow includes additional details where the mechanic is involved as well as the user stories it helps answer.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The first flow is for scheduling an appointment which is more straightforward, all steps are completed by the client. This flow has solutions for all 4 high priority user stories.</p>

                    <p>I had initially misunderstood LCB's business model and had laid it out similar to Velofix, which offers a variety of services at many different times.</p><br>
                    <p>I updated the digital wireframes to reflect LCB's schedule system which includes one or two specific dates and a set of times at 15 minute intervals.</p>

                        <h3>Visual Design</h3>

                        <p>The original plan was to redesign Left Coast Bicycles logo and stick with the same color palette. Through the design process, I decided to focus on the scheduling platform as its own thing and to revisit the LCB redesign later. </p><br>
                        <p>After discussing design preferences with the owner we decided we wanted the app to feel simple, friendly, and bike related.</p> <br>
                        <p>We initially came up with a list of words related to bikes, mobile, and repair. I landed on Gromm, which in the bike industry is a young inspired biker who hangs out around bike shops. The name was shorter, it wasn't taken in the app store or as a website, and invited the creation of a cute, cuddly Gromm character as the mascot.</p><br>
                        <p>For the logo, I wanted to incorporate a bike part. After a few iterations, I liked the way that Gromm fit into a chain link.</p>

The blues and greens also provided a more playful look and went well with Gromm.

                    <p>Once I finalized my style guide I started adding color and type to the wireframes. The design went through a couple of iterations after getting feedback from LCB's owner and completing a preference test.</p></div>

                    <p>While creating the initial layout I did a preference test using UsabilityHub for the scheduling layout. The results ended up being pretty even with option 'B' more preferred. Testers liked more white space and thought it was easier to read.

                <p>I asked users to complete the following Tasks:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Walk through the onboarding process
                    </li>
                    <li> Schedule a Safety check &#38; repair consultation</li>
                    <li>Find the details for their upcoming appointment</li>
                    <li>Find their final repair summary and pay for their repairs</li>

                <div class="chart-container"><canvas id="usabilityTest" height="175"></canvas></div>
                <p>My biggest takeaways were:</p><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>2 users found the onboarding skip button confusing and suggested a continue with account button.
                        </li>
                        <li> Everyone thought the scheduling was easy, one user suggested numbering each section to show it was steps instead of options.</li>
                        <li>One user suggested adding bike details and notes to the appointment summary so they could look back at what they told the mechanic.</li>
                        <li>3 of the 4 users clicked around before they saw the upcoming/past segmented tabs to find their summary and upcoming details.</li>
                        <li>2 users suggested incorporating the Gromm logo or link shape throughout the app.</li>

                    <p>After testing and additional feedback from users, designers, and the LCB owner I revised my designs to be more simple and coherent.</p><br>
                    <p>I removed the skip button from the upper right corner, rearranged the sign-up and create account buttons, and added a continue without account option. I also made the onboarding a carousel and added the Gromm mascot to walk everyone through.</p>

                    <p>I added the Gromm link to the background of the app and changed the background to blue with the blocks of information in White. I also added numbers to the scheduling screen to make it more clear that each section was a step.</p>

                    <p>Starting this project I had to make sure my goals were very clear. This is just the client facing part of the app, the mechanic side will come later. I knew it would be easy to get out of scope.  </p><br>
                    <p>I was also skeptical if a white-label platform like this might already exist. After some initial research, there was nothing that stood out that had all the features that Left Coast Bicycles needed.</p><br>
                    <p>After building the app I realized that while the app could work, I think this platform would be better as integration into LCB's website.</p><br>
                    <p>Going forward I want to go through the design process again for the Mechanic side and build this out as a web interface instead of a mobile application.</p>
