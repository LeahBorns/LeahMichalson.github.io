                    provide service for bike commuters at their offices over one week. LCB currently has clients
                    schedule, get reminders, and pay using three different apps. The owner wishes there was a way to
                    streamline his scheduling process to reduce manual input and reduce no-shows. We created Gromm, an
                    app that combines scheduling, reminders, and payment all in one app through the design process.</p>

                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>LCB currently uses Google Sheets to schedule events in real-time, Gmail to send reminders (manually
                    with templates), and square for payment processing. While there are many scheduling platforms
                    available, none offers real-time scheduling for discrete events, which LCB needs. This current
                    system requires a lot of manual input, and the lack of automation results in a lot of no shows. </p>
                <p>We want to figure out<span class="bold"> how we might create a more streamlined process to schedule
                        repairs for discrete events and reduce no shows. </span></p>

                    <h3>Roles </h3>
                    <p>I was the User Experience Designer. I conducted user research, created the personas, user flows,
                        wireframes, prototypes, and final user testing. I also collaborated with senior designers for
                        feedback along the way. I used Figma, Illustrator, and Adobe, XD.

                    <p>The project's scope is to create a working prototype of a client-facing bike repair scheduling

                <h3>The Solution</h3>
                    <p>The solution is a bike repair scheduling platform called Gromm. Clients can schedule, receive
                        reminders and alerts, and pay all in one place.</p>
                    <p>The current prototype is the client-facing part of the platform. Users can schedule a 15-minute
                        consultation with the onsite mechanic, see their upcoming and past appointments, receive
                        reminders before their meeting, and a reminder and final summary when their bike is complete.
                        These features will provide better communication to the client and a more streamlined system for
                        the mechanic to reduce no shows.</p>

                <h3>Discovery &#38; Research</h3>
                <p>I began digging into the mobile bike industry to see how their scheduling worked and what processes
                    they used. I completed a competitive analysis comparing Velofix, another mobile bike repair company,
                    Beeline, a scheduling and inventory platform for bike shops, and a popular scheduling platform,
                    Simplybook.me. </p>
                <p>I also sent out a user survey to LCB's clients to find the system's most significant pain points. I
                    found that most users wanted a confirmation after scheduling and a better way to reschedule. </p>

                <p>From the competitive analysis and user survey, I created two personas, Brenda and Grant.</p><br>

                        and manage their mobile bike repair fleet. Through the Velofix platform, you can schedule, get
                        reminders, and pay. While everything is in one place there isn't a mobile platform, the layout
                        is busy and discrete events can't be scheduled.
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Beeline</span> is a unique company that offers a scheduling platform for the
                        bike industry. Their software allows users and mechanics to schedule repairs, and organize
                        inventory all in one place. They do offer scheduling for discrete events however it's for a time
                        range vs specific intervals. Beeline also doesn't have a mobile platform.

                        also don't support scheduling for discrete events.</p>

                <p>With a better idea of the user's needs and the client's business objectives, I used user stories, and

                    <p>I broke the user flows up into three different parts. The second and third flows get a little
                        more complicated as they depend on the mechanic's input. To keep everything in scope, I included
                        additional details on each flow to show where the mechanic is involved and the user stories it
                        helps

                    <p>The first flow is for scheduling an appointment, which is more straightforward; the client

                <p>While exploring rebrand options, the owner of LCB had expressed interest in blues and greens as an
                    alternate color to his current colors, orange and gray. After some bike industry research, I found
                    that orange and gray were commonly used. The blues and greens also provided a more playful look and
                    went well with Gromm.
                </p>
                <p>The colors also had high contrast when used together for users who experience color blindness.</p>
                <p>For the typography, I initially chose Stozel. After adding it to the low-fi prototype, I found it
                    didn't fit with the app's look while it was a nice clean font. I ended up going with Proxima Nova, a
                    websafe font that's simple and doesn't draw attention to itself.</p><br>
                <p>I also followed apple's accessibility guidelines when choosing the font size and weight.</p>

                <p>Once I finalized my style guide, I started adding color and type to the wireframes. The design went
                    through a couple of iterations after getting feedback from LCB's owner and completing a preference
                    test.</p>
                <p>After the usability test and feedback received, we realized the platform would function better as
                    part of LCB's website. The most recent iterations are a responsive web version.</p>

                        </li>
                        <li>Everyone thought the scheduling was simple. One user suggested numbering each section to
                            show it was steps instead of options.</li>
                        <li>One user suggested adding bike details and notes to the appointment summary to look back at
                            what they told the mechanic.</li>
                        <li>Three of the four users clicked around before seeing the upcoming/past segmented tabs to
                            find their summary and upcoming details</li>
                        <li>Two users suggested incorporating the Gromm logo or link shape throughout the app.</li>

                <p>I removed the skip button from the upper right corner, rearranged the “Sign-Up” and “Create Account”
                    buttons, and added a continue without account option. I also made the onboarding a carousel and
                    added the Gromm mascot to walk everyone through.</p>

                <p>For the first iteration, I wanted to add a bike part to the scheduling screen's background. I mocked
                    up a couple of different versions with a cog and sent out a preference test using UsabilityHub. The
                    results ended up being pretty even, with option 'B' more preferred. Testers liked the white space
                    and thought it was easier to read.

                <p>After the usability test, I updated the scheduling screen to incorporate the link instead of the cog.
                    I updated the appointment details screen to have bike notes added by the client, and I updated the
                    onboarding walkthrough with a Gromm character I created.

                </p>
                <p>I reorganized all of the input and feedback from the first two versions to create a responsive web
                    platform. I redesigned the scheduling screen as a single section that populated the details as you
                    walked through the scheduling process. The appointment details screen became a dashboard that
                    grouped the client's consultation and repair appointments. I also added a notifications icon at the
                    top to remind users of upcoming appointments, updates to their appointment, and when their bike is
                    complete.

                <p>After testing the web platform, users like navigating Gromm as a web platform more. They also liked
                    having the consultation and repair as one event, so all repair details are in one place.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion </h3>
                <h4>Growth and Outcomes</h4>
                <p>Starting this project, I had to make sure my goals were very clear. The current prototype is just
                        the client-facing part of the app; the mechanic side will come later. I knew it would be easy to
                        get out of scope. </p>
                <p>After building the platform, I realized that while the app could work, I think it would be better
                        integrated into LCB's website. The most recent iterations reflect those changes.</p>
                <p>Going forward I want to go through the design process again for the Mechanic side and start
                        working with the owner to get this platform in the wild.</p>
